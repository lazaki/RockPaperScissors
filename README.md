# `Rock, Paper, Scissors` â€” Waste an hour having fun 

As a frequent games player I would like to play rock, paper, scissors so that I can waste an hour of my day having fun.


# Acceptance criteria
I can play Player Vs Computer
I can play Computer Vs Computer
I can play a different game each time
Game stores and displays current score. Score restarts once user restarts/ends the game
# `User Story Back`

#Technical constraints:
  It does not need to have a flashy GUI - it can be a really simple page
  Use one of the two popular JS frameworks for implementation: Angular1 
  Focus on Javascript code quality, best practices and design patterns (Model and Controller parts of MVC concept). Styling of frontend page is not of a big importance (it can be a really simple page) 

  In case you do not know the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors

#Guidance

It should take around 2 - 5 hours of effort when doing this, so please use this as an indicator of effort required.

I am not too bothered with the UI - that can be a simple web page
I am keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product.  As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time, though extra gold stars are given to people who get excited and do more because they are having fun.
Do you test drive your code?  
I also consider the extensibility of the code produced. The well-factored code should be relatively easily extended. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock may be a natural extension.
A Nice feature would be if for instance score is saved on browser's memory so that the game is not lost if the user refreshes the page by accident. This is bonus task just if you finish everything else and you feel like playing a bit.
Hint - spend some time on doing a research and find the best and simplest algorithm for the game
